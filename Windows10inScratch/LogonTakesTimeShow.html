<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Hello this is the logon.in sprite taking time to show!</h1>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Explaination and fix for the scratch devs</h2>
<p>to better optmize the logon area, i have hidden it until it detects logon_swipe_done called, there are other ways to fix it but there is a swipe up issue so its stuck like that. to fix change the call that starts the whole thing to "OS_Logon" instead of "logon_swipe_done"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
