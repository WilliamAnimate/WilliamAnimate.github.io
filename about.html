				<h1>where do i even start?</h1>
				<p>My journey here took a really, really long time, and a bunch of twists and turns.
						<br>
					It truely started all the way back at late 2016 or so, when I started learning Scratch. <b>Yeah, really, Scratch 2.0.</b><br>
					None of my old projects back then exist on the internet, in fact, they very likely are lost to time. The old Acer laptop i've used to create those projects has been wiped and reformatted several times.
				</p>
				<h1>2020 - The year where literally everyone became an introvert (or is that just me?)</h1>
				<p>
					My first real online presence was my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/william_animate">Scratch Account</a>, which has since been banned for the most random reason ever.
					<br>
					It was at this point when I discovered the world of malware. That was what sparked my interest to do more than just simple &lt;canvas&gt; games. <b>This was when I created my GitHub account.</b>
				</p>
				<h1>Today</h1>
				<p>Where do I even end? Ever since the hammer stuck on my Scratch account, i've done a lot more with "super advanced nerd 1337 hacker code stuff". So far, as of writing, i've dipped my toes into C#, assembly (never again), C++ and C, and got fairly proficient with Rust, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java.</p>
