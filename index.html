                    <p>I enjoy coding (most of the time), and my main language is Rust (no not the game)<br>

                    I also know a little bit of C and C++, but them segfaults :(

                <p>
                    Hi! idk what to say.<br>

                    You'll be able to get a pretty good understanding of me if you look at my git commits (either the title or desc)<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've been around scratch during 2020 to 2022, you may <i>not</i> recognize me (I never took off). But if you do recognize the username "WilliamAnimate" or "William_animate", its probably because <i>thats me!</i><br>I've forgotten my password so I don't know if im still blocked, but its probably due time to move on anyhow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    oh im also the one who made that stupid oneshot joke about something under niko's hat and it has like 30000 views right now (TF?) and me zooming into an image for 25 seconds which has 31000 views (What the f)<br>
                    it is safe to say there is zero quality put into it (maybe except for niko's hat, since i spent 4 hours on the svg)

                <p>(totally not showing off)^Uhow do you find out if someone is a linux user? they'll tell you. i use artix btw. how do you find out if someone uses BSD? you don't-- they're unaware of the concept known as 'outside'</p>
                <p>an aside: im also a BSD user, and im a shut-in</p>
                <p>okay okay, lmao. heres my tech stack, the important bits.</p>

                <p>all of my public projects can be found on my github and gitlab, the former being where i push most of my code to. i also have a codeberg, but i only push there when i contribute to projects hosted on codeberg <s>because the canadian mirror is actually so slow i cannot use it</s></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>twitter2nitter</li>
                    a standalone Firefox (and Chromium MV2) extension that redirects you from the website formally known as twitter to an instance of nitter. It has been deprecated once, because nitter died after guest accounts on twitter were severely restricted.
                    <li>sudo</li>
                    not to be confused with the sudo (commonly found in linux, BSDs) or sudo (for windows); sudo is a windows application (read: wrapper) that elevates your current shell to have the permissions of trustedinstaller- essentally root on windows.
                    its not very impressive, but now i can offically say that i made something before microsoft did (hehe).
                </ul>
                <h3>deprecated</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>optimize_my_roblos</li>
                    originally an app designed to help you gain more performance in Roblox, it has been deprecated in favor of the fflag editor present in bloxstrap, and i've switched to linux anyways, so there was no point in maintaining it any longer.
                    If you need performance in Roblox, <i>1. please use linux</i> and <i>2. use <a href="https://sober.vinegarhq.org">sober</a></i>. it gives you three times the performance of windows.
                    <li>possibly a lot more</li>
                    look, i have a lot of projects that i've worked on over the years, many of which aren't public. i can't possibly recall them off the top of my head.
