                        <p>I enjoy coding (most of the time), and my main language is Rust (no not the game)<br>
                        I am also capable of working in JavaScript (serverside js (bad imo)), JavaScript (browser), Web development and Java.<br>
                        I also know a little bit of C and C++, but them segfaults :(

                        Hi! idk what to say.<br>

                        You'll be able to get a pretty good understanding of me if you look at my git commits (either the title or desc)<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you've been around scratch during 2020 to 2022, you may <i>not</i> recognize me (I never took off). But if you do recognize the username "WilliamAnimate" or "William_animate", its probably because <i>thats me!</i><br>I've forgotten my password so I don't know if im still blocked, but its probably due time to move on anyhow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        oh im also the one who made that stupid oneshot joke about something under niko's hat and it has like 30000 views right now (TF?) and me zooming into an image for 25 seconds which has 31000 views (What the f)<br>
                        it is safe to say there is zero quality put into it (maybe except for niko's hat, since i spent 4 hours on the svg)
                    </p>
